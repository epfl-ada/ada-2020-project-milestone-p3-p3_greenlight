## 1) Context \[10sec\]

Hello ! We are team Greenlight.

In 2000, a large-scale program called Piso Firme offered households in Mexico cement floors to replace dirt floors. The paper ‘Housing, Health and Happiness’ aims to measure the impact of this program on health and welfare of young children and their mothers. 


## 2) Observational studies \[30sec\]

This study is what we call an observational study, because there is no random assignment to treatment groups. So omitted variable bias can affect treatment effect estimates. Using standardised mean differences we showed that the control and treatment data sets were not well balanced in terms of pre-treatment variables.


## 3) Matching \[30sec\]

A solution is to use matching. The idea is to create pairs with one treated and one control individual that have similar covariates. Different strategies are applied : the matching done in the paper using an L_infinite norm of four pre-treatment covariates, a propensity score matching using these same four variables and a propensity score matching using all variables.


## 4) Sensitivity analysis \[30sec\]

We assumed that the probability to be treated was 0.5 inside the matched pairs. But there might exists a unmeasured confouder that could unbalance this probability. Sensitivity analysis allows to quantify this discrepancy. And the second step called amplification, allows to discuss the existence of unobserved covariates.
