## 1) Context \[10sec\]

Hello ! We are team Greenlight.

In the 2000's, a large-scale program called Piso Firme offered households in Mexico, cement floor to replace dirt floor. The paper ‘Housing, Health and Happiness’ aims to measure the impact of this program on health and welfare of young children and their mothers.

## 2) Observational studies \[30sec\]

‘Housing, Health and Happiness’ is an observational study. Due to the lack of random assignment to treatment groups in this type of study, omitted variable bias can affect treatment effect estimates. Using standardized mean differences we showed that the control and treatment data sets were not balanced in terms of pre-treatment variables.

## 3) Matching \[30sec\]

A solution is to use matching. The idea is to create pairs with one treated and one control individual that have similar covariates. Different strategies are applied : the matching done in the paper using an $L_{\infty}$ norm of four pre-treatment covariates, a propensity score matching using these same four variables and a propensity score matching using all variables.
We can see that ...

## 4) Sensitivity analysis \[30sec\]

We assumed that the probability to be trated was $0.5$ inside the matched pairs. But there might exists a unmeasured confouder that could unbalance this probability. Sensibility analysis allows to quantify this discrepancy. And the second step called amplification, allows to discuss the possibility of the existence of an unobserved covariate.
